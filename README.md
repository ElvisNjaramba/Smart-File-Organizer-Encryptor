# TM_Encryptor
TM_Encryptor is an encryption decryption tool which can encrypt any file with any extention. 
It uses a special key generated while the files are encrypted and a pass phrase while in my case is Tariq to decrypt files.
Without the key and the pass phrase the files encrypted cannot be decrypted and hence render them useless.

Feel free to share and edit whatever you feel like. 

BE AWARE THIS CAN BE A VERY DANGEROUS TOOL ONCE MISHANDLED.
